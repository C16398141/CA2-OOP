<h3>The Meaning of Life</h3>

The purpose of the game is to prevent the circles of death from breaching your defenses. Armed with the touch of death, you must hunt these elusive foes down. In game upgrades occur to strengthen your defense when you reach score milestones. Friendly bots moves side to side while droids orbit your location.

<h3>The Challenges I faced</h3>

I expected to encounter challeneges along the way as I planned and embarked in this journey in February. However many of the problems that arose were completely unexpected. I didn't expect there to be difficulty pressing multiple arrow keys at once enabling the snakehead to move diagonally and smoothly. However one of the more annoying problems faced is the one that I coyldn't solve. I wanted the spawn rate of the enemies to increase with the score proportionally. However division by zero errors and other illogical errors occured even though my varations of logic was flawless. A shame but I wasn't perturbed, a few lines of hard-coding did the trick :P
